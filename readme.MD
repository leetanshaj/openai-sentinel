# OpenAI Sentinel Token Generator

This repository provides a Python-based implementation to generate **Proof of Work (PoW) tokens** and **Sentinel tokens** for bypassing security mechanisms in OpenAI's ChatGPT and Sora private APIs. By reverse engineering the browser's token generation process, this project enables programmatic access to these APIs without requiring manual interaction or browser-based token generation.

## Overview

OpenAI's private APIs, such as ChatGPT and Sora, use advanced security mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Sentinel tokens to prevent unauthorized access. These tokens are typically generated in the browser using a combination of cryptographic hashing, unique identifiers, and environmental data.

This project reverse-engineers the token generation process to allow developers to programmatically generate these tokens and interact with the APIs directly. This can be useful for automation, testing, or research purposes.

---
## Features

- **Proof of Work Token Generation**: Implements a hashing-based PoW mechanism to generate valid tokens.
- **Sentinel Token Generation**: Creates Sentinel tokens required for API authentication.
- **Reverse-Engineered Browser Behavior**: Mimics browser-specific configurations and environmental data.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify configurations like user agents, navigator keys, and more.

## How It Works
### Proof of Work (PoW) Token Generation
The PoW token is generated by solving a computational challenge. The process involves:
1. Generating a random seed and difficulty level.
2. Iteratively hashing the seed with encoded configuration data until the hash meets the difficulty criteria.
3. Returning the solution as a base64-encoded string.

The implementation is in [`proof_of_work.py`](proof_of_work.py), which uses cryptographic hashing (`sha3_512`) and base64 encoding to generate the token.

### Sentinel Token Generation
The Sentinel token is generated by:
1. Fetching API requirements using the PoW token.
2. Parsing the API response to extract necessary fields like `turnstile` and `token`.
3. Constructing a payload with the extracted data and generating the final Sentinel token.

The implementation is in [`sentinel_token.py`](sentinel_token.py), which handles API communication and token generation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/openai-sentinel.git
   cd openai-sentinel
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

## Usage
### Generating a Proof of Work (PoW) Token
To generate a PoW token, run the following command:
```bash
python proof_of_work.py
```
This will output a valid PoW token that can be used for API authentication.
### Generating a Sentinel Token
To generate a Sentinel token, run the following command:
```bash
python sentinel_token.py
```
This will output a valid Sentinel token that can be used for API authentication.
